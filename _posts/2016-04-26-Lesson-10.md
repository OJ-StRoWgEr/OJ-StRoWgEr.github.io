At the start of the lesson we were introduced to Microbit, it was the new hardware/software programming for year 7's and only year 7’s. Although it wasn’t very helpful because they were a month late and counting. So we had to improvise and go on the website…

We tried out individually how to use Microbit and we started on the JavaScript and then moved onto bigger and harder things like the Maze Runner programme which from experience is very difficult and frustrating. Though I managed to complete most of it in time for around about the end of the lesson…

We were not sent any homework except the blog which I have done right here because of the Microbit's not coming in time, the sad fact is that if they do not arrive before the summer then we will not get them at all, just in time for the new year 7’s!
