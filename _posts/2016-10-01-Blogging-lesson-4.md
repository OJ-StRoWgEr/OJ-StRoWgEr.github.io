    <td>I used trial and error when attempting things i don't know i also wrote notes on everything that we were told in lessons about excel so that when i forgot about something i could go back to my notes so then i would remember the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to always make sure that i write notes about what my teacher says in lesson as i am quite forgetful and it is very useful to have notes so then i won't forget anything and i will be able to finish my work without asking for help from anyone.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In future lessons i will make sure i write notes about every important thing that will aid me with my work during lessons. This will make me stop having to ask the teacher or my classmates about things if i forget or didn't hear during the lesson.</td>
