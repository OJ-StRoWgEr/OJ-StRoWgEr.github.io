    <td>Today i was meant to put my blogs in tables to make it look more organised. I think that i did make my tables look very nice and i think they matched the colour scheme and background. I did not really have any problems while trying to make the tables especially with the help from W3schools.</td>

    <td>During todays lesson we put tables into our websites for our blogs during the lesson i did not really have many problems especially since i used W3schools. Although i did have some errors with my code because i removed some parts of the code by accident but they were an easy fix.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For my next lesson i will make sure that i pay more attention while putting strands of code into the website code because if i delete something by accident it will be very hard to fix. I will also make sure i check wether there is a error with my code before i start coding because otherwise all my effort will be wasted.</td>
