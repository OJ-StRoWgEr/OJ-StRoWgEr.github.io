Starting the lesson off we talked about last week's homework, it was about what we either posted or commented and how it can affect our lives or job interviews in the future. This could turn out good or bad depending what you use it for. Maybe it could help you in work to show for the job being a lifelong goal or if you post something silly and immature they won't select you for the job and you will regret what you did in the end. We then grouped up in 3’s and had to create 10+ rules about social media to follow, some were good but others were mostly bad such as don’t talk to people that you don’t know because something bad is going to happen. On the flip side you can catch up with special and precious events from family members social media. The last part of the lesson we watched two short videos containing, firstly this woman wakes up and people on their phones and wherever she goes people aren't cherishing the moment but recording it on their phones and basically living on their phones. Also we watched a twitter musica where everyone who loves twitter and that their lives are complete and they even persuaded someone to use twitter but they also gave a few good points that twitter shouldn’t be mislead...
