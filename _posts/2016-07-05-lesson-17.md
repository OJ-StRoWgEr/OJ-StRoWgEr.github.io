[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506) - sexting

I was not in the lesson for this lesson as I was off playing a cricket match for the school. Though I have gained some knowledge of what happened.

After ages of waiting the Microbits have arrived and I wasn't even there! To start the lesson they had to set up the Microbits. The Microbits were continuously delayed and were due to arrive when we begun the topic. We were then told that we had to find revenge porn and sexting news articles and leave links in our blog post.

And then our homework was to spend 30 mins on our Microbit game and this blog post.
