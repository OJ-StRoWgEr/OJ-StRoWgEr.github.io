    <td> feel I got to on well with the Code Academy as it was simple and quite easy to learn especially in the form we are doing which is python , I worked strategically through the puzzles that I faced if i found a problem difficult I would use the hint option in the bottom left of the interface this is an extra clue that you could be missing in your code and it is very helpful.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Today nothing really limited my learning as I wasn't distracted and I tried to get on as quickly and as effectively as I could go. I think it was a very productive lesson. Also on my website I have changed the layout again I am trying to find the best contrasting colours</td>

    <td>Next time I will work the same and try to do as much as I can without getting anything wrong. But also do some at home to help remember what I have learnt to apply it to next week. I will try finish the course as one of the first people. I need to work rapidly but accurately.  </td>
