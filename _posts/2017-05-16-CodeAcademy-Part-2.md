  <tr>
    <td>I started off by reading the instruction then applying them and as I got to know python a bit more I started doing on my own work without the hints and I thought that helped develop my skills alot. I am now working alot quicker and also if I struggle with some of the harder codes my friend next to me who is similar ability works together with me to find a solution</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today nothing really limited my learning as I wasn't distracted and I tried to get on as quickly and as effectively as I could go. I think it was a very productive lesson. Also on my website I have changed the layout. I am experimenting with various colours and seeing which ones are nice together.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work the same and try to do as much as I can without getting anything wrong. But also do some at home to help remember what I have learnt to apply it to next week. I need to remember to close the squiggly brackets because I forget and then I have to go back on github and edit it again.</td>
