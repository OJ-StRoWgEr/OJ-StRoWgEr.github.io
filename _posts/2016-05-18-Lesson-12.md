As the week before Mr Keen set the homework of the Harry Potter sorting hat on JavaScript, which if you worked it out was really quite simple.

After Mr Keen gave us an explanation of the plan in the lesson which was to do six different tutorials on the new microbit which once again had not been delivered. Though I only completed two they weren't all easy because you had to complete an extension.

To finish the lesson we were told to do 20-30 mins of work on the other tutorials...
