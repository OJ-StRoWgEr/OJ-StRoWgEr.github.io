    <td>By staying on task and working well with my partner otherwise we would both not get anywhere or learn at all. When one person reads and one writes it is very effective because people can work quicker and more efficiently.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My ability to easily get distracted by things that have no relevance at all. I need to work on staying on task no matter the situation as I have been talked to about this by other teachers for my ability to be off task...</td>

    <td>My attention and patience because I could be struggling and annoyed with my work as it is not working but in actual fact it is me that is not working and I need  to work on that to improve myself and my capability.</td>
