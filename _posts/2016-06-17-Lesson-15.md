11 people hadn't done the homework, outrageous! Once everyone had told an excuse we moved on. We had time to catch up during the lesson if weâ€™d not done any homework. The homework task was given back to us to improve and look for any mistakes. 

Once that was over we made a start on our Micro:bit game, but only a simple start and not to hard on it. My game is the Yes or No rubber!

I quickly had to finish my coding at the end of the lesson and put the raw code onto google docs so I have my full coding on there even the tutorials of Javascript Micro:bit.

Once again our homework was to spend 30 mins on Micro:bit coding and create a blog post which I am doing currently...
