Today while trying to achieve my github site to the point of where I was happy but I had some troubles and many difficulties going through today's session.

The aim for today was to achieve making my site look cleaner and neater by changing font types and other colours.

Instead of achieving this I only managed to make it look worse by changing colour too a nasty dark grey this I feel needs to be changed to keep the site looking tidy.

Next week to try and right the wrongs I will make the colour a more fitting match to that of my background and will endeavour to stay on task and achieve this.
