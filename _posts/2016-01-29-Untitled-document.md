At the start of lesson 3 we were talking about advantages and disadvantages of social media, first of all the advantages. Some of them were like meeting new people, planning and arranging meetups with friends in chats or friends posting about what their recent activities have been. Though, some of the disadvantages, you could get stalked because anybody can see your social media even though you may be private. Also cyberbullying and grooming is a big factor as well. In no way can these be ok at all unless it's the police going undercover to find information about a criminal. The last thing that we had to do was arrange ourselves in groups of five and we were given a set of scenarios to put in order between worst thing to put on the internet to the most okay things to put in. They ranged from posting about you going on holiday and saying that you're house was empty and posting your mobile phone number or talking to a complete stranger about school work...
