Due to a change of timetable our IT lesson is now on Thursday instead of Friday, not only that but we were using a different room called IT2 and that room is where the Apple Macs are stored and usedâ€¦

To start off the lesson we were assigned to complete a survey based on how much freedom you have with devices at home and whether they are family devices or a personal device just for you. When we sent them in they were anonymous. After that we had been told to pair up to make a game on the website Microbit. 

Unfortunately this is where the lesson ended for me as I had to go to a cricket match with the school which we fortunately won!
