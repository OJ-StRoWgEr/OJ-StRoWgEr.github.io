In our lesson today we were looking at a few people's presentations, talking about grammatical errors and even people not putting the correct historical figures in chronological order. The task was set as a Prezi presentation and it was set to be on the history of computers…

4-5 people had to stay in for detention as they either hadn't posted the link properly or they hadn’t posted a link at all. 

After Looking at three people's presentations Mr Keen told us that we had to go away and improve our Prezi’s looking out for grammatical error, time order and to make sure it didn’t make people want to throw up.

When the bell went it was quite strange because the firebell went!!!
