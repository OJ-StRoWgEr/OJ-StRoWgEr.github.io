In today's I.T. lesson we explored a new website called Prezi, it's a cool, fun and interesting software for planning presentations or to help you with presentationsâ€¦ For much of the lesson we were told to mess around and play with all the different features of Prezi.Our teacher, Mr Keen showed us one of his Prezi presentations and he showed many interesting and amazing slides that shifted perfectly from one to another, either zooming in and out or spinning across or even just turning into the next one looked and moved together smoothly. 

Our homework over the holidays was to play around with Prezi...
