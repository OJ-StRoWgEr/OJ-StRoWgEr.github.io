  <tr>
    <td>Like most lessons i found taking notes the most effective way of learning, especially since i am extremely forgetful. Like most lessons this helped me to remember most tricky/long pieces of code that i would need to input into my spreadsheet to improve it. This also meant that i did not need to ask my peers or any other students for codes that i needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There was not a lot of things that did limit my learning but i was a little lazy and tried to use shortcuts to make it easier but this caused me to break my spreadsheet rather than improve it which caused me to waste more time in lesson which meant i had to do more homework to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time i will make sure that i put more effort into my blog in school and at home this will then make my blog look a lot better and i will hopefully get a much better grade.</td>
