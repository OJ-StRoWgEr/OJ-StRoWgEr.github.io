This is my first proper blog now I have got my github to work

Today I overcame the fact that I deleted my post folder

Today I made a new posts folder and now my github site is fit for publishing

From now on I am going to post blogs after every lesson to show what I have achieved

Today I achieved the ability to consistently blog 

The problems I overcame was creating a new posts folder and making my site up to shape for blogging in the future.
