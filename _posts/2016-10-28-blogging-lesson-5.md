  <tr>
    <td>Every time we were called to the front by our teacher i would bring my ipad so i could note down anything important. This helped me not forget any tricky code i would need for the sheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning except for writing down all the tricky commands needed for the sheet but i noted all of them down from the sheet i also double checked all the commands before i used them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that i note down all commands for sheets correctly so i don't become stressed later in the lesson. This should hopefully improve my learning for future lessons to come.</td>
