Today in I.T. Mr Keen told us about a boy called Breck Bednar who was being groomed online and his mum reported it to the police but they just let it happen. Also he showed us when you need to snitch and when not to, from small things like a pencil to a big thing about commiting suicideâ€¦

 We looked at a YOUTUBE series that contained a storyline called first to a million and it was about two brothers and sisters who were teaming up to gain 1,000,000 views first. It is set up in stages and the first scenario was that Tariq was going to jump out and scare an old man coming home. You had to decide which way to go as you were the cameraman. There were many of these and you had to decide the course of your journey. Tariq and Aleeyah make some pranks and challenges to get to 1,000,000 views but it ends up coming down to a party where Jamal has a plan to get 1,000,000 views and it's all about to work out until Megan and Jamal go upstairs inside the bedroom. But that was not the final bit because you had a choice to make, either go inside the room or forget about it. At the end of the lesson we visited the site called CEOP and it is for reporting and handling with things like these online with specialists.
