1: I found creating my identity map a fun process where I could show the class what Means a lot to me and what I'm passionate about. I knew what I wanted to put on my identity map so it felt like it was not too bad, overall I enjoyed creating my identity map…

2: I wanted to see if what they saw on my identity map would make them see me in a different way and I also wanted to make people intrigued about finding things out about me that they never even thought about me. For instance I got a comment on my A4 piece of paper saying that someone didn't know that I was a vegetarian…

3: I felt like there were many people being kind and giving constructive comments but I also hated how some people can be so mean just because it was an anonymous comment, not on my identity map but on someones who said that their idol was a particular sportsman and someone said they thought it was bad because that's who he looked up to…

4: I would have liked to see if people  would have commented exactly the same thing if they were face to face with me or if they would have said something nice because it seems that sometimes when people are being anonymous they take it as an opportunity to write hateful and mean comments.

5: Reading back on the comments sometimes I wasn't surprised and I knew when looking at other identity maps that I had nowhere near enough detail and description but some pictures of what I love. When I was explained to about when I couldn’t understand when I was told that I had too many pictures of my pets, I thought that that was crazy because I love them so much but then I realised that if I’d wrote about them instead would have given me a higher grade…

6: It's different because you aren’t showing someone that it’s you who are saying it… It's anonymous so you have more room to say what you actually feel without being hurtful unless you cross the line. 

7: I don't really think so but I will probably post things about my work and my pets or hobbies when I go out to do something that I love.

8: Not really, but when I'm older I definitely will use some of the medias I listed.

9: Yes, for sure, I've found out that media isn’t just Instagram, twitter and facebook but it’s other things like newspapers which really surprised me at first. I also view it as something that can be useful for yourself but can also be used against you as well. How easily giving a bit of information away on the internet can lead to something major like a kidnapping which I was shocked about…

10: I will use it for work related cases for most of the time but for catching up with friends and family and finding important things out like what time I need to go to the job interview or catching up on work in class that I wasn't at because then I’ll need help not knowing what we had covered in the lesson...
