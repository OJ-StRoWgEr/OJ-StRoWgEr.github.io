To begin the lesson as always we took a look at who had and hadn't done the homework task, 3 people hadnâ€™t but shortly after had sorted it out.

After a check to see if your blog post was how it was expected to be we were told to carry on working with our Microbit games.

The way we ended the lesson today was to fill in an assessment sheet on what extra-curricular house events you have done. In my case I ticked football, basketball, drama and House Cross Country.

Once you had sent your form in you could pack your bags and be off...
