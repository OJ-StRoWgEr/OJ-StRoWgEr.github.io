I learnt how media is not just social like: instagram, twitter, facebook and tinder. Because it can be in letters and newspapers. Afterall that's what they used to use when they did not have phones and androids… Mr Keen gave us the media literacy bingo and some of the questions were about media in general, here are a few of them: this person has access to the internet whenever they want to, this person has watched a video on youtube this week and this person plays video games at least twice a week. After the bingo we watched the new kia sol advert but what we did not know was the message about the age range, text and subtext. But that was after we had to get over the cute and cuddly hamsters. In the end we found out who they were aiming the car at, People looking for their first car. Text: telling us about the car that it's a new and improved version of the old one. Subtext: also the subtext was meaning that it was like strutting down the red carpet, that life is great… IF YOU BUY THIS CAR!!! That is how the lesson ended… After a few pointless questions!
